## Using Infusionsoft To Nail Your Post Sales Follow Up
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7c9404d0-f476-4f62-aca9-85545f026266.png)

You probably already know the importance of following up with your customers. But did you know that you can follow up more swiftly and effectively using[Infusionsoft][0]marketing automation software?

Here's how it works.

First, you should know that everyone likes to get follow up contacts. They might not act like it, but they do. So don't be put off by how your contact will be perceived. Just go ahead and do it. It's a good way to build your brand as well as an excellent way to groom returning customers.

At Stern we recommend that you reach out to your customers for a period of six months after closing a sale. You can use Infusionsoft to automate "soft touch" techniques such as emailed thank yous and reminders, or get a bit more personal and place a phone call or (in cases of larger accounts) invite someone to meet in person.

Why do we recommend following up for six months? Because[dozens of studies][1]and anecdotes (not to mention our own experience) indicate the same thing: if you contact a person 10 times over a three month interval, you increase your chances of closing a sale to approximately 90 percent.
